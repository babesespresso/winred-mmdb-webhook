### Webhook Features

   - Updates existing contacts based on email matching

2. **Data Mapping**:
   - First Name
   - Last Name
   - Email

   - Donation Date
   - Source (marked as "WinRed")

### Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues:

1. **Check Environment Variables**: Ensure all environment variables are correctly set in Vercel
2. **Verify API Credentials**: Make sure your GoHighLevel API key has the necessary permissions
3. **Review Logs**: Use `vercel logs` to check for any runtime errors
