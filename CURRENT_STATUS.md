# Current Status: WinRed to GoHighLevel Webhook

## ‚úÖ MAJOR PROGRESS: Webhook is Now Accessible!

Great news! The Vercel authentication has been successfully disabled. Your webhook is now publicly accessible and ready to receive data from WinRed.

### Latest Working URL
```
https://winred-mmdb-webhook-cdr9mxxk2-babesespressos-projects.vercel.app/api/webhook
```

## üü° Current Issue: GoHighLevel API Authentication

The webhook is working, but we're getting a 401 (Unauthorized) error from the GoHighLevel API. This means:

1. ‚úÖ WinRed can now reach your webhook
2. ‚úÖ The webhook is processing data correctly
3. ‚ùå GoHighLevel is rejecting the API credentials

## üîß Action Required: Verify GoHighLevel Credentials

### Step 1: Check Your GoHighLevel API Key
1. Login to GoHighLevel
2. Go to **Settings ‚Üí Integrations ‚Üí API Keys**
3. Verify your API key has these permissions:
   - Contact Read
   - Contact Write
   - Contact Create

### Step 2: Verify Location ID
1. In GoHighLevel, go to **Settings ‚Üí Company**
2. Copy the exact Location ID
3. Make sure it matches what's in Vercel

### Step 3: Update Environment Variables in Vercel (if needed)
1. Go to your Vercel project dashboard
2. Navigate to **Settings ‚Üí Environment Variables**
3. Update these values:
   - `GHL_API_KEY`: Your GoHighLevel API key
   - `GHL_LOCATION_ID`: Your Location ID

### Step 4: Redeploy After Updating
If you update the environment variables, redeploy:
```bash
vercel --prod
```

## üìä Testing the Integration

Once you've verified/updated the GoHighLevel credentials:

1. **Test with curl**:
```bash
curl -X POST https://winred-mmdb-webhook-cdr9mxxk2-babesespressos-projects.vercel.app/api/webhook \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "first_name": "Test",
    "last_name": "User", 
    "email": "test@example.com",
    "phone": "555-123-4567",
    "amount": "25.00",
    "campaign_name": "Scott Bottoms Campaign",
    "created_at": "2024-12-01T10:30:00Z"
  }'
```

2. **Update WinRed**:
   - Add the webhook URL to WinRed
   - Select "New Donations" event
   - Save and enable

3. **Make a Test Donation**:
   - Make a small donation in WinRed
   - Check GoHighLevel for the new contact

## üéØ What's Working Now

- ‚úÖ Webhook is publicly accessible (no more authentication blocking)
- ‚úÖ Webhook receives and processes POST requests
- ‚úÖ Data transformation logic is working
- ‚úÖ Enhanced logging is active

## üîç Troubleshooting GoHighLevel API

Common issues with GoHighLevel API:

1. **API Key Format**: Ensure you're using the full API key, not a partial one
2. **API Version**: The webhook uses API version 2021-07-28
3. **Location ID**: Must be the exact ID from your GoHighLevel account
4. **API Permissions**: Key must have contact create/update permissions

## üìù Summary

You're very close! The hard part (Vercel authentication) is solved. Now you just need to ensure the GoHighLevel API credentials are correct. Once that's fixed, donations will flow automatically from WinRed to GoHighLevel.
